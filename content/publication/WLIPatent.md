abstract: An apparatus and method of measuring biofilm and biological activity on a surface is disclosed. The apparatus includes a biofilm, which includes one or more microorganisms, grown on a substrate. A viewing window is placed on a surface of the biofilm and a gas bubble is introduced between the viewing window and the surface of the biofilm. The space between the substrate and the viewing window may be enclosed in a casing that has an inlet and an outlet, forming a flow cell. A microscope system, such as a white light interferometer, captures data of the biofilm in situ and non-destructively. The 3D images of biofilm surface have high resolution while maintaining a large field of view. This invention will be useful for fundamental studies of biofilms, biomedical and environmental screening, and many other applications in biology and the life sciences.
