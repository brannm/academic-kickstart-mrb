abstract:  "We present research that systematically examines acetone interacting with various D2O ices of terrestrial and astrophysical interest using time-resolved, in situ reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS). We examine acetone deposited on top of different D2O ice films: high-density, nonporous amorphous (np-ASW), and crystalline (CI) films as well as porous amorphous (p-ASW) with various pore morphologies. Analysis of RAIR spectra changes after acetone exposure, and we find that more hydrogen bonding occurs between acetone and p-ASW ices as compared to acetone and np-ASW or CI ices. Hydrogen bonding quantification occurred by two independent RAIR spectral changes: a greater relative intensity of the 1703 cm–1 feature at low acetone coverage as part of a 14 cm–1 shift in the C═O region and an ∼30% integrated dangling bond area reduction after acetone exposure. Interestingly, when changing the water structure to be more porous (deposited at 70° compared to 30°), there is a further reduction in the amount of hydrogen bonding that occurs. This suggests that there is a lack of access to surface sites with dangling bonds in the pores as initial layers of acetone block the pores and acetone is unable to diffuse within the structure at low temperatures. In general, these results offer a clearer picture of the mechanisms that can occur when small organic hydrocarbons interact with various icy interfaces; a quantitative understanding of these interactions is essential for the accurate modeling of many astrophysical processes occurring on the surface of icy dust particles."
