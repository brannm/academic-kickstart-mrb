abstract:  "We examine the initial differential sticking probability of CH<sub>4</sub> and CD<sub>4</sub> on CH<sub>4</sub> and CD<sub>4</sub> ices under nonequilibrium
flow conditions using a combination of experimental methods and numerical simulations. The experimental methods include timeresolved in situ reflection−absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS) for monitoring on-surface gaseous condensation and complementary King and Wells mass spectrometry techniques for
monitoring sticking probabilities that provide confirmatory results via a second independent measurement method. Seeded supersonic beams are employed so that the entrained CH<sub>4</sub> and CD<sub>4</sub> have the same incident velocity but different kinetic energies and momenta. We found that as the incident velocity of CH<sub>4</sub> and CD<sub>4</sub> increases, the sticking probabilities for both molecules on a CH<sub>4</sub> condensed film decrease systematically, but that preferential sticking
and condensation occur for CD<sub>4</sub>. These observations differ when condensed CD<sub>4</sub> is used as the target interface, indicating that the
film’s phonon and rovibrational densities of states, and collisional energy transfer cross sections, have a role in differential energy
accommodation between isotopically substituted incident species. Lastly, we employed a mixed incident supersonic beam composed
of both CH<sub>4</sub> and CD<sub>4</sub> in a 3:1 ratio and measured the condensate composition as well as the sticking probability. When doing so, we
see the same effect in the condensed mixed film, supporting an isotopic enrichment of the heavier isotope. We propose that
enhanced multi-phonon interactions and inelastic cross sections between the incident CD<sub>4</sub> projectile and the CH<sub>4</sub> film allow for
more efficacious gas−surface energy transfer. VENUS code MD simulations show the same sticking probability differences between
isotopologues as observed in the gas−surface scattering experiments. Ongoing analyses of these trajectories will provide additional
insights into energy and momentum transfer between the incident species and the interface. These results offer a new route for
isotope enrichment via preferential condensation of heavier isotopes and isotopologues during gas−surface collisions under
specifically selected substrate, gas-mixture, and incident velocity conditions. They also yield valuable insights into gaseous
condensation under non-equilibrium conditions such as occur in aircraft flight in low-temperature environments. Moreover, these
results can help to explain the increased abundance of deuterium in solar system planets and can be incorporated into astrophysical
models of interstellar icy dust grain surface processes."
