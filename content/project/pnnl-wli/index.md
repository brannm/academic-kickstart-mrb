During my gap year as a research associate at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) in the National Security Directorate, my main project focused on designing a 3D printed flow cell and a novel method to monitor and quanitify three-dimensional topology and structure of live biofilms with white light interferometry (WLI). In additon to a flow cell, my work also demonstrated the feasibility of WLI as a tool to non-descructively characterize and count bacterial colonies on agar before they became visble to the naked eye.
