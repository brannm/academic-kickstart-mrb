As a PhD student in Prof. Steven Sibener's lab, I also completed a side project that explored the destruction of surface-adsorbed nerve agent simulants <em>via</em> rapid laser heating under atmospheric conditions. Following Nd:YAG laser ablation, both parent and product fragments are transmitted <em>via</em> capillary from an atmospheric chamber to a vacuum chamber containing a high-resolution mass spectrometer for real time measurements of product distributions under a various temperature and atmospheric conditions.
