As a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Ã–berg Astrochemistry Lab, I investigate the formation and abundance of molecules in interstellar ice analogs relevant to planet formation. My first project examined the photodestruction of ozone and acetonitrile, revealing a novel pathway for complex organic molecule formation via oxygen insertion on icy grains.  Additionally, I am analyzing millimeter ALMA observations of a massive protostar to determine molecular abundances and conducting Gaussian calculations (in collaboration with David Woon) to explore the fate of hydronium ions under electron bombardment.
