My graduate research explores the impact of condensed-phase film morphology on reaction kinetics and surface adsorption. To do this I conduct my experiments under ultra-high vacuum (UHV), which simulates the cold and low pressure conditions experienced in space, to understand the chemical processes allowing for accretion, release, and aggregation of gases within cometary ices.  By using in-situ reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS) in conjunction with King and Wells mass spectrometry techniques, my first project examined the sticking probability of CH<sub>4</sub> on various D<sub>2</sub>O ices of astrophysical interest. My second project examined oxidative reactivity of condensed propene films. Alkene oxidation is an important reaction in atmospheric smog formation, combustion processes, formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and soot. Additionally, small alkenes and oxygen are also present in trace amounts in the interstellar medium and condensed-phase oxygen addition pathways could suggest novel channels for chemical complexity in ices.

In addition to projects on my main molecular beam scattering UHV chamber, I also completed a side project that explored the destruction of surface-adsorbed nerve agent simulants **via** rapid laser heating under atmospheric conditions. Following Nd:YAG laser ablation, both parent and product fragments are transmitted *via* capillary from an atmospheric chamber to a vacuum chamber containing a high-resolution mass spectrometer for real time measurements of product distributions under a various temperature and atmospheric conditions.
