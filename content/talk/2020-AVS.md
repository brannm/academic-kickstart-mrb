summary: The American Vacuum Society Prairie Chapter covers Illinois, Indiana, and eastern Wisconsin and hosts and annual regional meeting. Due to COVID-19, this meeting was virtual. 

abstract: "We present work detailing the destruction of surface-adsorbed nerve agent simulant, diisopropyl methylphosphonate (DIMP) via rapid laser heating under atmospheric conditions. Following Nd:YAG laser ablation, both parent and product fragments are transmitted via capillary from an atmospheric chamber to a vacuum chamber containing a high-resolution mass spectrometer. This allows for real time measurements of product distributions under a variety of temperature and atmospheric conditions. We show that product distributions depend on laser-induced surface temperature rise, simulant structure, and atmospheric oxygen content. Specifically, for DIMP, the relative production of alkene products depends significantly on laser power; smaller products are more likely to result from higher ablation temperatures.  We also show that in the absence of oxygen, the relative amount of oxygenated products decreases sharply relative to alkene and alkane products. This observation suggests that under high-temperature conditions atmospheric oxygen is incorporated directly into the products of the fragmented simulant. This project extends significantly our understanding of the fundamental surface chemistry of these dangerous compounds under rapidly changing thermal conditions.  This knowledge informs chemical warfare agent mitigation strategies, which is of critical importance to national defense initiatives."
