summary: The Transcending Boundaries Research Symposium is designed to highlight the work of graduate students and postdoctoral scholars at the University of Chicago Due to COVID-19, this meeting was virtual. 

abstract: "I conduct experiments at low pressures with frozen ice films to mimic conditions seen in space. I focused on the initial step of this process—the probability that a molecule of methane sticks to an ice film—because that foundation facilitates the subsequent formation of small organic molecules and organic life forms. I also examined the reaction of these molecules to understand how these reactions differ at cold temperatures. My work is the first demonstrating ice structure importance for sticking and reactivity. These results allow us to create accurate models of the processes occurring in atmospheric and terrestrial environments and to determine planetary atmospheres’ gas compositions. These results help us better understand solar system formation and origin of life in the universe. Studying reactions between molecules in astrophysical environments can help us understand processes occurring on Earth and find novel ways to harvest energy and limit our dependence on fossil fuelds. On Earth, massive amount of methane is stored in clathrates – gas surrounded by a cage of water molecules. These largely untapped energy reserves are of interest, but not without understanding how methane interacts with its cage."
