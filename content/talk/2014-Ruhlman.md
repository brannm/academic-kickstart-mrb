title: The Role of Copper in the Oxidative Stress Response of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to heat shock (Oral)
event: Ruhlman Conference
#event_url: https://example.org

location: Wellesley College
address:
 

summary: The conference is intended to foster collaboration among students and faculty across the disciplines and to enhance the intellectual life of the College. 

abstract: "In response to stress, cells produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) which cause molecular damage in the form of DNA breaks and modification of lipids and proteins. ROS are also important in cell signaling to induce differential gene expression, metabolic changes and, thus, adaptation to environmental conditions. I hypothesize that ROS response is a common denominator of different environmental challenges, including radiation and microgravity, during spaceflight. Algae, such as the unicellular green alga *Chlamydomonas reinhardtii*, grown in spaceflight are exposed to stress. The goal is to characterize the response of *C. reinhardtii* to stress by examining biochemical and gene expression changes using heat shock. The heat shocked (42Â°C) *C. reinhardtii* exhibited a selective regulation of ion transporters and an increase in ROS. Such results provide new insights about the cellular response to stress and its possible mediation during long-term environmental pressure (including spaceflight), and provide a basis for understanding multicellularity evolution."
