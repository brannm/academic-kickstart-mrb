summary: Influence of film morphology on the oxidation of propene thin films

abstract: "We present results detailing the oxidative reactivity of condensed propene films with particular interest towards epoxidation product formation. These studies were conducted in a state-of-the-art ultra-high vacuum gas-surface chamber equipped for operation involving cryogenic substrate temperatures. After exposing propene films to a supersonic beam of ground state atomic oxygen, O(<sup>3</sup>P) generated from a radio frequency plasma source, RAIR spectra confirm significant propene reactivity towards a variety of products including the propylene oxide, as well as propanal and a small amount of acetone. These products differ greatly from the gas phase products (methyl and vinoxyl radicals, ethylene, and formaldehyde) since in the condensed phase, the excess energy can be dissipated by additional propene molecules on the surface so that adduct products dominate. Although the initial linear reactivity is independent of film thickness for films up to 30 ML, the amount of propanal and propylene oxide produced eventually plateaus at an amount proportional to the amount of propene starting material. Additionally, by exploring initial reaction rates at surface temperatures ranging from 44 K to 59 K, we are able to elucidate the activation energy for the reaction. Our calculated/observed activation energy (0.5 kcal mol-1) closely matches those reported in gas phase studies of the same system. We also note that propene crystallinity is important for reactivity as only the surface layers of amorphous propene react due to limited oxygen diffusion into the bulk film. Film composition might be able to explain slower initial rates as well as how O(<sup>3</sup>P) is unable to fully erode thicker films. Overall, this work provides fundamental mechanistic insight into the diffusion and reactivity of ground state atomic oxygen in condensed films of small, unsaturated hydrocarbons which we hope to extend to probe sterically/geometry constrained olefins reactions."
