summary: The American Vacuum Society Prairie Chapter covers Illinois, Indiana, and eastern Wisconsin and hosts and annual regional meeting. 

abstract: "We present work detailing the sticking probability of CH<sub>4</sub> on various D<sub>2</sub>O ices of astrophysical interest using a combination of time-resolved, in situ reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS) and King and Wells mass spectrometry techniques. As the incident translational energy of CH<sub>4</sub> increased (up to 1.8 eV), the sticking probability was observed to decrease for all ice films studied, which include high-density, non-porous amorphous (np-ASW) and crystalline (CI) films as well as porous amorphous (p-ASW) films with various pore morphologies. Importantly, sticking probabilities for all p-ASW films diverged from and remained higher than either np-ASW or CI films at the highest translational energies studied.  This trend was consistent across all porous morphologies studied and did not depend on pore size or orientation relative to the substrate. It is proposed that in addition to offering slightly higher binding energies, the porous network in the D<sub>2</sub>O film is very efficient at dissipating the energy of the incident CH<sub>4</sub> molecule.  These results offer a clear picture of the initial adsorption of small molecules on various icy interfaces; a quantitative understanding of these mechanisms is essential for the accurate modeling of many astrophysical processes occurring on the surface of icy dust particles."
