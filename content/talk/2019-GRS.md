summary: Influence of film morphology on the oxidation of propene thin films

abstract: "We present results detailing the oxidative reactivity of condensed propene films with particular interest towards epoxidation product formation. These studies were conducted in a state-of-the-art ultra-high vacuum gas-surface chamber equipped for operation involving cryogenic substrate temperatures. After exposing propene films to a supersonic beam of ground state atomic oxygen, O(<sup>3</sup>P) generated from a radio frequency plasma source, RAIR spectra confirm significant propene reactivity towards a variety of products including the propylene oxide, as well as propanal and acetone. Moreover, multilayer propene film thickness appears to influence oxygen diffusion and mobility within the film, and therefore the resulting product formation. Although the initial linear reactivity is independent of film thickness, the amount of propanal and propylene oxide produced eventually plateaus at an amount proportional to the amount of propene starting material. Additionally, by exploring initial reaction rates at surface temperatures ranging from 44 K to 59 K, we are able to elucidate the activation energy for the reaction. Our calculated/observed activation energy (0.5 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>) closely matches those reported in gas phase studies of the same system. We also note that propene crystallinity is important for reactivity as amorphous propene films have limited reactivity. Overall, this work provides fundamental mechanistic insight into the diffusion and reactivity of ground state atomic oxygen in condensed films of small, unsaturated hydrocarbons. In particular, understanding and maximizing propylene oxide production is important industrially to make polyurethane plastics."
