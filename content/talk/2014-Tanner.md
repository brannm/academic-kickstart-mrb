abstract: "This summer, I was a member of the NASA Ames Academy for Space Exploration which mentors future leaders of the American Space Program by exposure to how the system works. As a research associate, I spent the majority of my time working on my individual research using algae as a model organism to understand the intracellular response to stress as it relates to evolution and mitigating this response during spaceflight. As a member of the “Academite” team comprised of nine other engineers and scientists, I developed and collected data for our Carbon dioxide and Germinating Seed (COGS) Study towards the ultimate goal of human settlement beyond Earth. Additionally, I had the opportunity to meet numerous figureheads in the space industry and to tour other NASA centers and private aerospace companies. Through this challenging and unforgettable summer as a leader, I confirmed my passion for a career in the space industry."
