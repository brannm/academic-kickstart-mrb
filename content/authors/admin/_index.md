I am currently a 4th year Chemistry PhD candidate in the [Sibener Group] (http://sibener-group.uchicago.edu) exploring gas-surface dynamics at the University of Chicago. For the 2019-2020 academic year, I am serving as co-President of my department's <a href="https://voices.uchicago.edu/womeninchemistry/"/target= "_blank">Women in Chemistry</a> organization. I am also a member of the <a href="https://acsycc.org/" target="_blank">National Younger Chemists Committee</a> of the American Chemical Society. After graduating from Wellesley College in May 2015 with a BA with Honors in Chemistry and a minor in Mathematics, I worked for one year as a research associate at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in the National Security Directorate.
